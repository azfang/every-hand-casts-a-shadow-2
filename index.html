                <p>How to Stay in Position / Cursor Dance</p>
                <p>DS: Wolfgang, it’s an honor for me to talk to you and I want to thank you for allowing me to use an image
                    of yours for my novel. But first I wanted to ask, did you take any photos of the recent strawberry moon?</p>
                <p>WT: Ah, I did. But it’s a sad story. I did photograph the moon on Wednesday night and woke up in the morning to the
                    message from my assistant that [artist] Juan Pablo Echeverri died that night in Bogota. He was an incredible
                    queer icon. I’m sure you would have loved him.</p>
                <p>DS: I’m sorry for your loss. And to have it come at the time of the strawberry moon, which is about abundance
                    and things blossoming and coming to life, is quite poignant. Are you planning to take photos of the planetary
                    alignment that’s happening on Friday?</p>

                <p>WT: Sometimes astronomy, as it’s reported in the news, is too hyped up. But there was one particular event
                    that happened in my life, the great conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter at the end of 2020, where I looked
                    through my telescope and I could see Saturn and Jupiter in the same frame. You could see Saturn being much
                    fainter and Jupiter being brighter, which of course is because Saturn is much farther away. I had this
                    feeling of real space within the solar system.</p>
                <p>DS: I couldn’t see the moon clearly until I was about 14. I know you grew up with a love of astronomy, but I was
                    incredibly short-sighted as a kid, and I was hiding it from my family because I was already being bullied for
                    being feminine. When I was diagnosed as needing really thick glasses at seven by a traveling nurse who had come
                    to school, I lied to my family. So I still remember that moment of everything in the night sky going from this
                    milky texture to something that had real clarity. I know you are including some of your astronomy works in your
                    upcoming MoMA show. There are going to be about 350 works from over the course of your career. How do you go about
                    preparing for a show like that?</p>
