                <p>DS: Wolfgang, it’s an honor for me to talk to you and I want to thank you for allowing me to use an image
                    of yours for my novel. But first I wanted to ask, did you take any photos of the recent strawberry moon?</p>
                <p>WT: Ah, I did. But it’s a sad story. I did photograph the moon on Wednesday night and woke up in the morning to the
                    message from my assistant that [artist] Juan Pablo Echeverri died that night in Bogota. He was an incredible
                    queer icon. I’m sure you would have loved him.</p>
                <p>DS: I’m sorry for your loss. And to have it come at the time of the strawberry moon, which is about abundance
                    and things blossoming and coming to life, is quite poignant. Are you planning to take photos of the planetary
                    alignment that’s happening on Friday?</p>
                <p>WT: Sometimes astronomy, as it’s reported in the news, is too hyped up. But there was one particular event
                    that happened in my life, the great conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter at the end of 2020, where I looked
                    through my telescope and I could see Saturn and Jupiter in the same frame. You could see Saturn being much
                    fainter and Jupiter being brighter, which of course is because Saturn is much farther away. I had this
                    feeling of real space within the solar system.</p>
                <p>DS: I couldn’t see the moon clearly until I was about 14. I know you grew up with a love of astronomy, but I was
                    incredibly short-sighted as a kid, and I was hiding it from my family because I was already being bullied for
                    being feminine. When I was diagnosed as needing really thick glasses at seven by a traveling nurse who had come
                    to school, I lied to my family. So I still remember that moment of everything in the night sky going from this
                    milky texture to something that had real clarity. I know you are including some of your astronomy works in your
                    upcoming MoMA show. There are going to be about 350 works from over the course of your career. How do you go about
                    preparing for a show like that?</p>
                <p>WT: It’s daunting and exhilarating at the same time. If you ask 10,000 artists where they would like to show most,
                    MoMA would be the place that most would mention. So, I feel incredibly lucky and happy that this honor is bestowed
                    onto me, but at the same time, in terms of the practical things, it’s important for me to capture a sense of
                    discovery and freedom and the ability to move around freely in my exhibition.</p>
                <p>DS: The exhibition is titled “To look without fear.” Tell me, what is looking without fear?</p>
                <p>WT: I think of the title as a hope, an encouragement, and a demand. On the one hand, I hope that I’m able to look without
                    prejudice, with great openness, and I hope my work is an encouragement for people to face reality, to not be afraid of
                    seeing things how they are. But it’s also a demand that we have the right to live without fear, without looking at the
                    truth and being punished for it. Particularly as a gay man, we grew up always with a different perspective on reality,
                    and to look at the world in that way was induced with fear. So it’s also hope for that to end.</p>
                <p>DS: I was thinking about looking without fear, and how that idea keeps shifting within my own work and my own lifetime,
                    and how we must never take our liberties for granted. The image you let me use for the cover of Young Mungo has such
                    resonance because my relationship with it has changed over 20 years. At first, it was an image that I felt quite shocked
                    by, because I was so unused to, as a young gay man in the early 2000s, seeing two men kissing. And then it’s something
                    I feel very protective of now because it’s a very ordinary demonstration of love. It’s an everyday expression of desire.
                    When I think about fear, I think about the journey that photograph may have gone on, but then also about the hatred that
                    is brewing in America at the moment towards queer life and how terrifying that is.</p>
                <p>WT: I saw a lot coming, but I didn’t see the “Don’t Say Gay” situation we are facing now. I thought with someone like Peter
                    Thiel in the Donald Trump circle, that they would stay clear of directly going homophobic. But then again, why would I have
                    thought that when they go directly misogynistic and against women’s rights? I took the picture you’re talking about in 2002.
                    To photograph a kiss is extremely difficult. Of course there are a million kisses, but they can so easily be contrived the
                    moment you add a third person to the mix. When two people are performing a kiss, it’s terrible, but it was the first explicit
                    gay kiss in my work and I felt the power of it so much that I overcame my hesitation to publish it, because I didn’t know who
                    the two were. Twenty years later, the mystery was solved and I was able to give one of them the print. He lives in Nepal now.</p>
                <p>DS: Really? Whoa.</p>
                <p>WT: I put it in my first American museum survey exhibition that toured from Chicago to Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., where the
                    picture was attacked, slashed by somebody with a key, ripped. It came as a shock. But I’ve always been struck by the fact that
                    you can show two men killing each other at three in the afternoon in any country in the world on public television, but you can’t
                    show two men kissing each other.</p>
                <p>DS: Certainly, it’s an image that has been a call for solidarity and defiance in the queer community. It was an image that was
                    actually so central to the writing of my book. It’s funny that you talk about finding the young man in the photo, because I
                    based the character of James Jameson on the blonde in that photograph. I fell in love. I spent hours thinking about how to
                    describe him and these beautiful pink ears and the desire and vulnerability and tenderness that I find in that kiss. There’s
                    a real affection and openness in your work, particularly in your portraiture. Your Taschen edition published in 1995 was
                    actually the very first art book I bought. I was still in high school and it was all these young people living on the fringes
                    of their sexuality, of political activism. They came into my life when I really needed them. I wonder how you feel about
                    those photos now. </p>
                <p>WT: That touches me, when I hear what you just said. To genuinely touch people in other countries is the best thing that can
                    happen to an artist of any medium. I was touched by Bronski Beat’s “Smalltown Boy” coming on the radio around the time of my
                    16th birthday in 1984, when I had my coming out.</p>

                <p>JCO: My household emergencies are all taken care of.</p>
                <p>MO: That’s good.</p>
                <p>JCO: We don’t have to go into the details, but there was a snake loose in the house. Now the snake is caught.</p>
                <p>MA: Was it a small snake?</p>
                <p>JCO: It was a very small snake. But creepy and slippery.</p>
                <p>MA: It was a very small snake. But creepy and slippery.</p>
                <p>JCO: Joyce, that kind of thing shouldn’t put you off—you write gothic!</p>
                <p>MA: Probably not. But here is your new book. It’s called Babysitter and it’s on sale in August, which is coming
                    up very quickly, and you gave me nightmares. It’s set in Detroit of 1977. It’s a love song to Detroit, but a
                    rather dark love song.</p>
                <p>JCO: The novel’s background is fairly authentic. There was a serial killer who was known as The Babysitter who was
                    active at the time when my husband Ray and I were living in Detroit. There was an organization I belonged to called
                    the Detroit Women Writers Association. These women were suburban wives and mothers, but they were also writers.
                    I learned a lot about the suburbs of Detroit, which fascinated me. Then in 1976 or 1977, these killings began to
                    take place. They were children who were vulnerable, who might have been going to the drugstore or hitchhiking on
                    Woodward Avenue. I tried to write about what it’s like to be in the middle of something.</p>
                <p>MA: Yeah, start in the middle. As you know, that’s how the Iliad starts. </p>
                <p>JCO: We all have a vague idea of a destination, but we don’t know how we’re going to get there.</p>
                <p>MA: Yes, and even the destination can be open ended, as it is with your book—not to give away anything. This book
                    actually made me feel quite anxious.</p>
                <p>JCO: Yeah, and then I moved to Windsor, Ontario. That’s a part of my life that I feel very sentimental about.
                    But this is about the Detroit part of my life. Everything was very heightened. There’s an antic feel. I was so
                    haunted by that city. It’s very deeply imprinted in me right now, like a dream.</p>
                <p>MA: Of course not. And we’re not there yet, because if we were there, you and I would not be having this conversation.
                    You’d be in a dungeon, Joyce. I’m not giving up on the United States so easily. Some people are really fighting tooth
                    and nail to keep from sliding back into the 17th century, because the other people seem to wish to live under an
                    absolute monarch. The Murdoch empire has now decided that Trump is unfit for office, so let’s see how that plays out.</p>
                <p>JCO: I did research into the Babysitter years after I left the area. I don’t want to sound conspiratorial, but there are
                    pedophile rings. I discovered years later that the Babysitter was either in one of those assemblages of predators or
                    known to them, and somebody probably knew that he was the Babysitter. There is this phenomenon of people who know and
                    don’t do anything about it.</p>
                <p>MA: Yeah, start in the middle. As you know, that’s how the Iliad starts. </p>
                <p>JCO: We all have a vague idea of a destination, but we don’t know how we’re going to get there.</p>

                <p>DS: Wolfgang, it’s an honor for me to talk to you and I want to thank you for allowing me to use an image
                    of yours for my novel. But first I wanted to ask, did you take any photos of the recent strawberry moon?</p>
                <p>WT: Ah, I did. But it’s a sad story. I did photograph the moon on Wednesday night and woke up in the morning to the
                    message from my assistant that [artist] Juan Pablo Echeverri died that night in Bogota. He was an incredible
                    queer icon. I’m sure you would have loved him.</p>
                <p>DS: I’m sorry for your loss. And to have it come at the time of the strawberry moon, which is about abundance
                    and things blossoming and coming to life, is quite poignant. Are you planning to take photos of the planetary
                    alignment that’s happening on Friday?</p>
                <p>WT: Sometimes astronomy, as it’s reported in the news, is too hyped up. But there was one particular event
                    that happened in my life, the great conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter at the end of 2020, where I looked
                    through my telescope and I could see Saturn and Jupiter in the same frame. You could see Saturn being much
                    fainter and Jupiter being brighter, which of course is because Saturn is much farther away. I had this
                    feeling of real space within the solar system.</p>
                <p>DS: I couldn’t see the moon clearly until I was about 14. I know you grew up with a love of astronomy, but I was
                    incredibly short-sighted as a kid, and I was hiding it from my family because I was already being bullied for
                    being feminine. When I was diagnosed as needing really thick glasses at seven by a traveling nurse who had come
                    to school, I lied to my family. So I still remember that moment of everything in the night sky going from this
                    milky texture to something that had real clarity. I know you are including some of your astronomy works in your
                    upcoming MoMA show. There are going to be about 350 works from over the course of your career. How do you go about
                    preparing for a show like that?</p>
                <p>WT: It’s daunting and exhilarating at the same time. If you ask 10,000 artists where they would like to show most,
                    MoMA would be the place that most would mention. So, I feel incredibly lucky and happy that this honor is bestowed
                    onto me, but at the same time, in terms of the practical things, it’s important for me to capture a sense of
                    discovery and freedom and the ability to move around freely in my exhibition.</p>
                <p>DS: The exhibition is titled “To look without fear.” Tell me, what is looking without fear?</p>
                <p>WT: I think of the title as a hope, an encouragement, and a demand. On the one hand, I hope that I’m able to look without
                    prejudice, with great openness, and I hope my work is an encouragement for people to face reality, to not be afraid of
                    seeing things how they are. But it’s also a demand that we have the right to live without fear, without looking at the
                    truth and being punished for it. Particularly as a gay man, we grew up always with a different perspective on reality,
                    and to look at the world in that way was induced with fear. So it’s also hope for that to end.</p>
                <p>DS: I was thinking about looking without fear, and how that idea keeps shifting within my own work and my own lifetime,
                    and how we must never take our liberties for granted. The image you let me use for the cover of Young Mungo has such
                    resonance because my relationship with it has changed over 20 years. At first, it was an image that I felt quite shocked
                    by, because I was so unused to, as a young gay man in the early 2000s, seeing two men kissing. And then it’s something
                    I feel very protective of now because it’s a very ordinary demonstration of love. It’s an everyday expression of desire.
                    When I think about fear, I think about the journey that photograph may have gone on, but then also about the hatred that
                    is brewing in America at the moment towards queer life and how terrifying that is.</p>
                <p>WT: I saw a lot coming, but I didn’t see the “Don’t Say Gay” situation we are facing now. I thought with someone like Peter
                    Thiel in the Donald Trump circle, that they would stay clear of directly going homophobic. But then again, why would I have
                    thought that when they go directly misogynistic and against women’s rights? I took the picture you’re talking about in 2002.
                    To photograph a kiss is extremely difficult. Of course there are a million kisses, but they can so easily be contrived the
                    moment you add a third person to the mix. When two people are performing a kiss, it’s terrible, but it was the first explicit
                    gay kiss in my work and I felt the power of it so much that I overcame my hesitation to publish it, because I didn’t know who
                    the two were. Twenty years later, the mystery was solved and I was able to give one of them the print. He lives in Nepal now.</p>
                <p>DS: Really? Whoa.</p>
                <p>WT: I put it in my first American museum survey exhibition that toured from Chicago to Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., where the
                    picture was attacked, slashed by somebody with a key, ripped. It came as a shock. But I’ve always been struck by the fact that
                    you can show two men killing each other at three in the afternoon in any country in the world on public television, but you can’t
                    show two men kissing each other.</p>
                <p>DS: Certainly, it’s an image that has been a call for solidarity and defiance in the queer community. It was an image that was
                    actually so central to the writing of my book. It’s funny that you talk about finding the young man in the photo, because I
                    based the character of James Jameson on the blonde in that photograph. I fell in love. I spent hours thinking about how to
                    describe him and these beautiful pink ears and the desire and vulnerability and tenderness that I find in that kiss. There’s
                    a real affection and openness in your work, particularly in your portraiture. Your Taschen edition published in 1995 was
                    actually the very first art book I bought. I was still in high school and it was all these young people living on the fringes
                    of their sexuality, of political activism. They came into my life when I really needed them. I wonder how you feel about
                    those photos now. </p>
                <p>WT: That touches me, when I hear what you just said. To genuinely touch people in other countries is the best thing that can
                    happen to an artist of any medium. I was touched by Bronski Beat’s “Smalltown Boy” coming on the radio around the time of my
                    16th birthday in 1984, when I had my coming out.</p>

                <p>In his 1960–61 manifestos on auto-destructive art, Metzger speaks of an art that “re-enacts” capitalism’s “obsession with destruction. </p>
                <p>Writing in the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Anders argues that we have become “inverted Utopians”: while “ordinary Utopians are
                    unable to actually produce what they are able to visualize, we are unable to visualize what we are actually producing.” This Promethean
                    Gap—the distance between our capacity to produce and our power to imagine—defines the moral situation facing us today. Our society of
                    machines and technological devices (the quintessence of science, and hence of “progress” and “morality”) has allowed the great dream
                    of omnipotence to finally come true. This dream, however, turns out to be the very nightmare from which we cannot awake, precisely because
                    “we are [now] in a position to inflict absolute destruction on each other.” With these new apocalyptic powers, we enter what Anders calls
                    “The Last Age”: an age in which the old Socratic question “How should we live?” has been replaced with the altogether more terrifying
                    “Will we live?”</p>
                <p>According to Dupuy, in Anders’s parable the catastrophe is both necessary, fated to occur, and a contingent accident, one that need not happen.
                    The way out of this paradox, based on a new understanding of the relation between future and past, requires us to act as if the catastrophe
                    has already happened—or is fated to happen—in order to prevent it from becoming true. By acting as if the catastrophe has already taken place,
                    we are able to project ourselves into the postapocalyptic situation and ask what we could and should have done otherwise.</p>
                <p>Our task is thus not to try to avert the worst by prophesying it, but rather to find ourselves within the current moment of crisis and catastrophe,
                    to take the reality of extinction as our starting point, and, in this context, to recall Walter Benjamin’s words that revolutions aren’t necessarily
                    the locomotives of world history, but rather “an attempt by the passengers on [the] train … to activate the emergency break.” What needs to be
                    halted, immediately, is capital’s war against the planet and all living things which inhabit it.</p>
                <p>Today is the last day of “frogs begin singing” or 蛙始鳴 — And it’s on this day we’re launching the website
                    pentad.world, or “Seasons in Pentameter.”</p>
                <p>The chain was a single linear series, beginning with God, angels, and man and descending to animals, plants, and rocks. This deeply held idea brought
                    together the notion of plenitude—the belief that the world is full, complete, and perfect—with the notions of continuity and gradation—the view that
                    all things could be lined up on a vertical scale with no discernible gaps between them. The species comprising the great chain were seen to exist in
                    a mutually dependent relationship: if a single link was broken, the entire edifice would collapse, with disastrous consequences for nature.</p>
                <p>There is something not only modern but also distinctly modernist about Cuvier and his ideas. His invitation that we follow “in the infancy of our own
                    species, the almost erased traces of so many extinct nations” finds itself echoed nowhere more clearly than in the First Letter of Paul Valéry’s 1919
                    essay “The Crisis of the Mind.” As Valéry writes: “We later civilizations … we too now know that we are mortal … And we see now that the abyss of history
                    is deep enough to hold us all. We are aware that a civilization has the same fragility as a life.”</p>
                <p>The slogan “Climate Chaos: We’re Fucked” now appears on XR stickers, leaflets, and fly posters worldwide; “We’re F**ked” also features as the title of a
                    section in a recent book, Another End of the World is Possible, by the environmentalist John Halstead. The phrase “we’re fucked” should indeed strike us
                    as rather odd, managing as it does, in this particular context, to connect extinction and sexual gratification.</p>
                <p>The eco-masochist position is sustained, at least in part, by a specific set of signifiers: the “Anthropocene” (that now infamous discourse of doom,
                    irreversibility, and species alienation), “deep adaptation” (a term denoting a new kind of blackpilled eco-survivalism, inviting ethical and “spiritual”
                    reflection on “our way of life” in the face of inevitable social collapse), along with the neoliberal empty rhetoric of “sustainability” and “healing.”</p>
                <p>All of these terms, in different ways, feed into a politics of passive annihilation. In this respect, critique will therefore need to be (in Wittgenstein’s phrase)
                    a critique of language: an investigation into the attractions, ideological connotations, and unmapped unconscious significances of certain words; an investigation
                    that will, at the same time, also be a reminder that “words are also weapons, explosives or tranquilizers and even poisons”; and indeed that
                    the whole political struggle “may be summed up in the struggle for one word against another.” This fight over language is a fight for an unfucked future.</p>
